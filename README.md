1. Jupiter Notebook:

Run the try.ipynb to obtain the full dataset. I have included the three playlist url list on it. The first one is the full data from 2010-2020, the second one is 2021 and the third one is the 2022 playlist. 

I have included the json dataset in case you do not need to run the scraping script (the 1000 dataset takes ~~ 20 minutes to execute)

2. Python:

We have already deployed the website. Here is a link to it:
